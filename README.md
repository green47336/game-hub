- Front end project for displaying various game data via the [RAWG Video Games Database API](https://api.rawg.io/docs/).
- You will need to supply your own http://rawg.io API key. Make a ```.env``` that supplies it as ```VITE_RAWG_API_KEY```.

```js
yarn install
yarn dev
```

- This project expands upon Mosh Hamedani's React 18 + TypeScript course: https://codewithmosh.com/
