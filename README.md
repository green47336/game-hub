- Front end project for displaying various game data via the [RAWG Video Games Database API](https://api.rawg.io/docs/).

- The requests are now sent to a proxy server to hide my API key, thus trying this out locally won't really work. The proxy expects all requests to come from the deployed domain.

- This project expands upon Mosh Hamedani's React 18 + TypeScript course: https://codewithmosh.com/
