- This project follows Mosh Hamedani's tutorial on his React 18 + TypeScript course.
- You can find the course I used on his website: https://codewithmosh.com/
- Here is his source code: https://github.com/mosh-hamedani/game-hub
- You will need to supply your own http://rawg.io API key. Make a ```.env``` that supplies it as ```VITE_RAWG_API_KEY```.

```js
npm i
npm run dev
```
